# Build Configuration Notes

Workarounds to fix build issues in cloud environments.

## Segmentation Fault (SIGSEGV) Fix

Several settings to prevent segmentation faults during builds on Vercel and Netlify:

### 1. Disabled Parcel Workers (`PARCEL_WORKERS=0`)

`package.json` build script
```json
"build": "PARCEL_WORKERS=0 NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024 parcel build src/index.html"
```

Stops Parcel from using multi-threading, which causes memory issues in CI environments. Fixes those frustrating SIGSEGV crashes that happen right after the build finishes.

Parcel v2.15.0+ uses worker threads for parallelization. In memory-constrained CI environments, these workers can cause heap allocation failures leading to process termination with signal `SIGSEGV`. The error typically appears in CI logs as `Error: Command "npm run build" exited with SIGSEGV` or in Vercel as `Running "npm run build" - Build error occurred`.

### 2. Memory Limitations (`NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024`)

In build script as above--caps Node.js memory to 1GB so it doesn't go crazy with crash-inducing memory usage.

This flag explicitly sets the heap limit to prevent out-of-memory crashes. Without this, Node may attempt to use more memory than available, triggering the Linux OOM (Out Of Memory) killer or causing segmentation faults.

### 3. Disabled CSS Optimizers

**Location:** `.parcelrc`
```json
"optimizers": {
  "*.css": []
}
```

Completely turns off Parcel's CSS optimizers (mostly LightningCSS) which kept contributing to segfaults/build issues. Otherwise it uses LightningCSS (a Rust-based CSS parser and minifier) via WebAssembly, which is prone to memory corruption issues when processing complex CSS from Tailwind. The empty array `[]` disables the default `@parcel/optimizer-css` entirely. Error signatures include `SIGSEGV` after successful CSS processing or failures specifically with `path*.css` files in the build output.

### 4. Optimization Disabled in Targets

**Location:** `package.json` targets section
```json
"targets": {
  "default": {
    "optimize": false
  }
}
```

Turns off Parcel's optimizers to prevent memory issues. Disables minification, tree-shaking, and scope hoistingâ€”all of which can trigger Parcel's internal issues with CSS processing and memory management. This forces Parcel to use simpler transforms that are less likely to trigger the WASM-related memory corruption in LightningCSS.

## PostCSS Configuration

### CSS Comments Handling

**Location:** `.postcssrc` and `package.json` devDependencies
```json
// .postcssrc
{
  "plugins": {
    "postcss-discard-comments": { "removeAll": true },
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
  }
}

// package.json
"postcss-discard-comments": "^7.0.4"
```

Addresses the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'input')" error from PostCSS. 

Adding `postcss-discard-comments` with explicit configuration ensures comments are processed correctly before they reach stages where the error would occur. The error signature is `PostCSS error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'input')` or similar stack traces involving comment parsing.

## When to Revisit
1. Upgrading Parcel to a new major version
2. Upgrading Tailwind/PostCSS
3. If Vercel/Netlify change their Node setup

The ideal solution would be to use standard configurations without these workarounds, but currently, they're necessary for stable builds in cloud environments.
