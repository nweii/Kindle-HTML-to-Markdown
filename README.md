# Kindle-HTML-to-Markdown

While viewing a book's highlights, notes, and bookmarks in the Kindle app, you can tap the Share button to export everything as an HTML file. This is a simple web utility that converts that HTML file into to a Markdown file perfect for Obsidian and similar note apps.

## To-dos
- Indicate highlight color
- Add optional `^` tags for linking to specific highlights in Obsidian
- Allow different styling options for Highlights, Notes, and Bookmarks
